# tty-colors
change colors in tty (linux console, not X)

Run tty-colors.sh to change the colors (still only 16) available to you in the linux console.

Won't work inside tmux, has to be in the linux console (as in after sign-in).

The colors come from the base16-xresources repo: https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-xresources
